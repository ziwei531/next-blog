This Project was created as a practice for me to explore how next.js works and also to work on my css skills. In this website, you will notice I have created card-like elements to encase articles at the home page, and also a card-like content encasement when you are viewing the articles that you have clicked. Overall, I am very happy with the result as it proves that my css skills have definitely improved, which also coincided the moment after I have completed freeCodeCamp's certificate for Responsive Web Design. 

The certification can be viewed [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ziwei/responsive-web-design) if you are curious.
